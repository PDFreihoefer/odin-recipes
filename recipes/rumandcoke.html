            The rum and coke is a classic drink enjoyed by college students that shouldn't be drinking it yet (in the US)
            and our elders that still enjoy this simple classic. Assuming that Coca-Cola outlives most of us this drink will
            continue to be enjoyed by our future generations for eternity.
